GENERALIZED LANDCOVERS DATASET
Based on the original map data (c) Openstreetmap contributors ODbL
Format: ESRI Shapefile

WHAT THIS DATASET IS
This dataset is generalized representation of the land covers, extracted from Openstreetmap data.
Objects with landuse=* and natural=* tags are used. 

Those generalized polygons can be displayed on zoom levels z0-z8 (scales approximately 1:500M - 1:2M),
 where standard OSM tiles (known also as  osm-carto style) are boring and empty.
