PLACES DATASET
format: ESRI Shapefile
based on the original map data (c) Openstreetmap contributors ODbL

This dataset is a generalized representation of the populated places extracted from Openstreetmap data.

All the populated places in this dataset  contain calculated Cartographic Importance, basing on which those objects
can be selected for display zoom levels z0-z8 (scales approximately 1:500M - 1:2M), where standard mapnik (aka OSM CartoCSS)
is boring and empty.

Fields:
osm_id:
    Original osm id
place: 
    Original osm place classificaiton
name: 
    Name in local language
population: 
    osm population value
r1ix: 
    Code of h3 grid cell, where the popualted place is located
rank: 
    the cartographic importance value, calculated using the GRID CELL method.
           The lower the rank, the more important the place is.
