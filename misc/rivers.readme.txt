This file contains generalized river geometries for low-zoom rendering (z0-z8).

The river network has been simplified from OpenStreetMap data. Each river segment includes the following attributes:
- osm_id: The original OSM way ID of one of the segments that formed this edge.
- width: The calculated or propagated width of the river.
- rank: A calculated rank representing the river's significance in the network. Higher ranks correspond to more significant rivers.
- name: The name of the river, if available.
- role: The role of the segment in a waterway relation (e.g., 'main_stream'), if available.
