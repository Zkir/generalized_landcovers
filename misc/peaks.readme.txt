PEAKS DATASET
Format: ESRI Shapefile
based on the original map data (c) Openstreetmap contributors ODbL


This dataset is a generalized representation of the mountain peaks extracted from Openstreetmap data.

All the mountain peaks in this shape file contain calculated Cartographic Importance, basing on which those
objects can be selected for display zoom levels z0-z8 (scales approximately 1:500M - 1:2M), where standard 
mapnik (aka OSM CartoCSS) is boring and empty.

FIELDS:
osm_id: Original osm id
name: Name in local language
name_en: Name in English where present.
ele : Elevation in meters
ix: Code of h3 grid cell, where the peak is located
score: the cartographic importance value, calculated using Discrete Isolation method.
           The higher score, the more important the peak is.
