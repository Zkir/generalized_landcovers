## Project Overview

This project, `generalized_landcovers` (also known as `OpenLandcoverMap`), is designed to create generalized landcover maps from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, specifically for zoom levels z0-z8. The standard OSM map can appear empty at these zoom levels, and this project aims to provide a more visually informative map by generalizing landcover features.

The core idea is to use a hexagonal grid (H3) to process OSM data. For each cell in the grid, the project identifies the dominant landcover type based on the area it covers. These cells are then merged to create larger, generalized polygons, which are then styled and rendered into map tiles.

The project uses a combination of technologies:

*   **PostGIS:** A PostgreSQL extension for storing and processing geospatial data.
*   **H3:** A hexagonal hierarchical spatial index.
*   **Mapnik:** A toolkit for rendering maps.
*   **Python:** Used for various scripting and data processing tasks.
*   **Make:** For orchestrating the build and data processing pipeline.

## Building and Running

The project uses a `makefile` to manage the build process. Here are the key commands:

*   `make all`: This is the default command. It runs the entire data processing pipeline, which includes:
    *   Creating tables in the PostGIS database.
    *   Generating shapefiles from the database tables.
    *   Creating a `mapnik.xml` file from the `.mml` and `.mss` style files.
    *   Generating MBTiles for the final map.
*   `make test`: Runs a test script (`test.py`) that likely renders a sample map and compares it to a reference image to ensure the output is correct.
*   `make clean`: Removes generated files and drops the `h3` schema from the PostGIS database.
*   `make import_planet`: Imports a full OpenStreetMap planet file into the PostGIS database. This is a long-running process.
*   `make update_db`: Updates the PostGIS database with the latest changes from OpenStreetMap.

## Development Conventions

*   **Build Process:** The entire build and data processing pipeline is managed by the `makefile`.
*   **Data Processing:** The core generalization logic is implemented in SQL scripts, which are located in the `sql-scripts/` directory. These scripts are executed by `psql` commands in the `makefile`.
*   **Styling:** The map's visual appearance is defined in `.mss` (Map Style Sheet) files. These are compiled into a `mapnik.xml` file using the `carto` tool.
*   **Map Layers:** The `project.mml` file defines the layers of the map, referencing the shapefiles generated by the data processing pipeline.
*   **Scripting:** Python scripts are used for various helper tasks, such as generating taginfo JSON and creating HTML pages.

## Plan: Modernizing the Rendering Stack

The goal is to enhance the interactive web map by switching to vector tiles, while continuing to provide Shapefiles as a primary download artifact. This plan outlines a dual-output strategy.

### Dual-Artifact Approach

The project will produce two sets of outputs:
1.  **Shapefiles (`.shp`):** For download and use in desktop GIS software. The generation process for these remains unchanged.
2.  **Vector Tiles (`.mvt`):** For a fast and interactive web map. This is a new addition to the workflow.

### High-Level Migration Plan

1.  **Preserve Shapefile Generation:** The existing targets in the `makefile` that use `ogr2ogr` to create Shapefiles from PostGIS tables will be kept as is. The process of creating downloadable `.zip` archives will also remain.

2.  **Add Vector Tile Generation:**
    *   New targets will be added to the `makefile`.
    *   These targets will read from the same final PostGIS tables (e.g., `h3.landcovers_aggr`, `h3.places`).
    *   They will use PostGIS's built-in `ST_AsMVT()` function to generate Mapbox Vector Tiles (`.mvt`) directly from the database.
    *   The output tiles will be stored in a separate directory, such as `data/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt`.

3.  **Implement Client-Side Rendering:**
    *   A lightweight tile-server can be set up to serve the newly generated `.mvt` files.
    *   The web map interface will be updated to use a client-side rendering library like **MapLibre GL JS**.
    *   A new JSON-based style file will be created to define the map's appearance, replacing the need for `.mss` files for the web map.

4.  **Update Build Workflow:**
    *   The parts of the `makefile` responsible for rendering **raster tiles for the web map** (i.e., using `carto` and `node ../tilemill/index.js` to create PNGs/MBTiles) can be deprecated and removed.
    *   The Shapefile generation workflow remains fully intact.

This approach ensures that the project's existing functionality is preserved while adding the significant benefits of a modern, vector-tile-based web map.
