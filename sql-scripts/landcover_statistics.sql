ice --> is not it the same thing as glacier?

rock, stone  -- is just a single notable rock/stone, not a landcover like 'blockfield.


paddy --> farmland?? paddy is a rice field 
greenhouse_horticulture -- this is rather built_up. Since greenhouse is a building. 
animal_keeping
agricultural
pasture -->meadow  landuse=pasture should be meadow=pasture


moor -- deprecated.
barren??

railway

recreation_ground -- it's something like partk

forestry -- not clear is it the same thing as forest



aquaculture -- landuse=aquaculture -- not completely clear :  "there is no convention on the exact meaning of this tag."Ð«






windfarm -- not clear what it is
observatory -- landuse = observatory -- deprecated. 

playa -- is the same as dry_lake?
